YASH
====

**Yet Another SHell** (YASH) is a basic Linux shell built on C with minimum library dependencies.

The requirements for this software are outlined in the following document:

[EE382V - Systems Programming Project 1: yet another shell (yash)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XVBlxWYLyrwk0E2jrCo95J3zRjEoht-KK5qnZSFFKBE/edit?usp=sharing)


Building
--------

For a standard build of the project run the following command from the root folder of the project:

```console
$ make
```

Other building options are as follows:

1. `$ make yash`: build the project normally.

2. `$ make debug`: build the roject with debugging symbols for GDB.

3. `$ make clean`: remove object files from previous builds.


Running
-------

After building the project the `yash` executable should appear inside the `/bin/` directory. To run the shell use the following command from the same directory where the executable is placed:

```console
$ ./yash
```

More Information
----------------

The project is written in C using the C11 standard. It has been compiled and tested using the following environment:

* Processor: Intel Core i5-3337U CPU @ 1.80GHz Ã— 4
* Memory: 6GB
* OS: Ubuntu 19.04 Desktop x86_64 GNU/Linux
* Linux Kernel: 5.0.038-generic
* Compiler: GCC 8.3.0
* Debugger: GDB 8.2.91.20190405-git


TODO
----

1. Write 2 test programs (1 outputs stuff other takes in stuff) instead of using
utilities like `sleep` to test the shell.

2. First do redirection, and then pipe the output if there is a pipe. I believe
this means that if there is output redirection in the lhs, the output goes both
to the output file and the pipe. This is not the same behavior of Bash. In Bash,
the output will only go to the lhs redirection file, and it will not go into the
rhs of the pipe.

3. Use `_exit()` instead of `exit()` to get out of child processes ([explanation here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5422831/what-is-the-difference-between-using-exit-exit-in-a-conventional-linux-fo)).
